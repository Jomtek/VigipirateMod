# Vigipirate Mod for GTA 5
I'm proud to be french, and I find GTA solo sometimes annoying. That's why I made the Vigipirate mod.
Now, you are safe when driving throught the city, when driving throught the hoods... Because many little military patrols are scattered throughout the city.

They will protect you from attackers, but don't even think about trying to kill a soldier !
